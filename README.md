## Inception
I came across an interview from Asian Boss about Chul-eun Lee, a former high-ranking North Korean government official who defected to South Korea. He now runs a Youtube channel making videos about his experiences. I emailed him using Google translate, and this project was born. It is a personal website with multi-lingual support and blog post funcitonality.

## Tech
- React (Typescript)
- Next.Js
- Sass
- Deployed on Netlify

I decided half-way through the project to switch to Typescript, because I am a sheep.
